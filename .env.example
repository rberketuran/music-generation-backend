# Supports single URL or comma-separated multiple URLs
# Examples:
#   Single URL: FRONTEND_URL=https://your-frontend.vercel.app

# FRONTEND_URL=https://your-frontend-domain.com

# Allow Vercel preview deployments (default: true)
# When set to "true", automatically allows all *.vercel.app domains
# This is useful for Vercel preview deployments which have dynamic URLs
# Set to "false" to only allow explicitly listed FRONTEND_URL values
# ALLOW_VERCEL_PREVIEWS=true

# Allow all origins (set to "true" for development/testing only, "false" for production)
# WARNING: Setting this to "true" allows requests from any origin - use with caution!
# ALLOW_ALL_ORIGINS=false

# Render-specific: PORT is automatically set by Render, no need to configure
